This website is the closest I’ve come to blending creativity and technical work in one place. It’s where design instincts and problem solving naturally come together, without me having to force it in one direction or the other. I use it to build things, try ideas visually, and think through how they actually work behind the scenes. It reflects how I like to approach projects when I’m allowed to be both curious and practical at the same time.
